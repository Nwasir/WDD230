                <p>Despite beign called "white", this space doesn't literally need to be white. Any type of space that
                    serves as a background for the content or funtional elements can be considered white space.</p>

                <P>Alignment is an important principle of design. It helps create a sharp, ordered appearance for
                    ultimately
                    better designs by ensuring your various elements have a pleasing connection with each other. Center,
                    right, or left-aligned text is the most common, but you can also align text to other objects in your
                    graphic. If something looks not quite right in your design, check your alignment.</P>

                    It will help to
                    establish hierarchy and add visual interest</p>
                <p>Contrast is probably one of the most important tools for designers and illustrators to make their
                    work
                    stand out and look professional. However, it can be tricky to get your head around what this term
                    means
                    and how to introduce it into your creative work.</p>
